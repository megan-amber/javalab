# Project Name: Megan Gerth's Calculator Program
## Project Description
This project showcases a variety of Object Oriented Programming principles
in the Java language in the form of a calculator program. User's can perform basic math operations, 
store values in memory, and display certain information about the values stored in memory. 
## Project Tasks
- **Week 1: User Interaction and Input/Output**
- Created the Operations class
- Created a scanner to accept user input
- Output some instructions to the user
- **Week 2: Software Design**
- Allowed users to enter an operation, eg. 5 + 6
- Displayed the result
- Determined how user's will interact with program
- **Week 3: Arrays and Lists**
- Utilized an ArrayList to hold memory values
- Passed arrays to functions 
- **Week 4: Exception Handling**
- Implemented try-catch blocks to handle exceptions
- Learned how to throw exceptions and catch them
- Debugged the program
- **Week 5: Finalize the project**
- Performed some final debugging
- Encapsulated the memory functions
- Submitted all work to github
## Project Skills Learned
- Java Language Basics
- Object-Oriented Programming framework
- Arrays and ArrayLists for handling data
- Try-catch-finally blocks for exception handling
## Language Used
- **Java**: Utilized to showcase Object Oriented Programming basics.
